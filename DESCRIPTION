Description: A comprehensive backup and offline management system for R packages 
    from multiple sources (GitHub, CRAN, Bioconductor). Unlike installation-only 
    tools, rBackup focuses on creating reliable offline archives, automated backup 
    workflows, and enterprise-grade package management. Features include automated 
    CI/CD integration, compliance reporting, and seamless integration with existing 
    R package management tools.
